## Official devices

If you have a working device tree/kernel, and would like to submit it for official builds, please check [this url](https://github.com/TheXPerienceProject/official_devices/blob/master/README.md) for more instructions. Please note - your device **must** have full hardware support (i.e., every peripheral works) and **must** be stable.

The XPerience wiki provides instructions based on the assumption that your device has got its device tree and required depedencies under the [TheXPerienceProject GitHub organization](https://github.com/TheXPerienceProject).

## Setting up the wiki locally

See [this url]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/contributing/wiki/) for detailed instructions on setting up the wiki locally.

## Adding your device

### Prepare the required files

There are a few files which need to be there to have a device on the wiki.
In order to get them, navigate to `~/wiki/` and run:

```
./scripts/generate_device.sh your_device
```

Obviously replace `your_device` with the codename of your device

### Populating the YAML

The sample template has been copied to `~/wiki/_data/devices/your_device.yml`.

Update the values to match your device. An explanation of some of the options is below.

Some of the properties allow specifying different values for multiple models being covered in the same file.
In that case the format stays the same as for a single device, but is used in a Key-Value style like this:

```
property:
- Model1: Value
- Model2: Value
```

An example using the `battery` property:
Just one device:

```
battery: {removable: False, capacity: 1000, tech: 'Li-Ion'}
```

vs. two different models:

```
battery:
- Model1: {removable: False, capacity: 1000, tech: 'Li-Ion'}
- Model2: {removable: True, capacity: 2000, tech: 'Li-Po'}
```

The following list will mention Model-Value pairs where applicable.


#### List of properties

{% assign definitions = site.data.schema.definitions %}
{% assign properties = site.data.schema.properties %}

* `architecture`: The CPU architecture of the device, can be one of

  ```
  {{ definitions.valid_architectures.enum | join: ', ' }}
  ```

  If your device has a 64 bit architecture but Android runs on 32 bit, you can use a different format: `{cpu: 'arm64', userspace: 'arm'}`

* `battery`: Use the format `{removable: False, capacity: <number in mAh>, tech: '<tech>'}`. If your battery is removable, use `True` instead.
  For `tech` you can use:

  ```
  {{ definitions.battery_data.properties.tech.enum | join: ', ' }}
  ```

  This property supports Model-Value pairs.

* `bluetooth`: The proper format is either `{spec: '<version>'}` with `version` being the version of the BT protocol supported, or `{spec: '<version>', profiles: '<profiles>'}` when your device
  supports additional profiles. These are the possible values:

  ```
  For the specification:
  {{ properties.bluetooth.properties.spec.enum | join: ', ' }}

  For the optional profiles:
  {{ properties.bluetooth.properties.profiles.items.enum | join: ', ' }}
  ```

* `camera`: One entry for each camera in the format

   ```
   - {flash: '<flash>', info: 'x MP'}
   ```

  with `flash` being one of
  ```
  {{ definitions.camera_data.properties.flash.enum | join: ', ' }}
  ```
  and `info` in the format `x MP` or `x MP (wide)` (wide, ultrawide, depth, etc. can be used), or `x MP (Model1) or x MP (Model2)` if necessary

* `cpu`: The CPU type of the device, can be one of the following list:

  ```
  {{ properties.cpu.enum | join: ", " }}
  ```

* `dimensions`: Use the format `{width: '', height: '', depth: ''}` with `123 mm (12.3 in)` being the proper format for each of them (including the exact whitespaces!).

  This property supports Model-Value pairs.

* `download_boot`: Instructions for booting the device into the mode used to install recovery. On most devices, this is fastboot mode.
* `install_method`: Used to determine the recovery install template to use. Templates can be found in *_includes/templates/recovery_install_*`install_method`*.md* and must be one of:

  ```
  {{ properties.install_method.enum | join: ", " }}
  ```

* `network`: The frequencies and channels for the various network technologies. You can look them up [here](https://www.frequencycheck.com/models/). Keep the non-available technologies empty.
* `peripherals`: A list of peripherals available on the device, can be any of the following list:

  ```
  {{ definitions.valid_peripherals.items.enum | join: ", " }}
  ```

* `release`: Allowed formats are `yyyy`, `yyyy-mm` and `yyyy-mm-dd`. This property supports Model-Value pairs.

* `screen`: Use `{size: '<screen size>', density: <number>, resolution: '<1234x567>', technology: ''}` with `123 mm (12.3 in)` as the proper format for `size`,
  a number for `density`, `1234x567` for `resolution` and a string for `technology`.
  Please look at other devices in order to use the same names for same technologies across all devices!

  This property supports Model-Value pairs.

#### List of optional properties

There are some optional properties which you might not need, but in case you do, they are documented below:

{% include alerts/important.html content="Remove any of these properties in case they don't apply for your device!" %}


* `before_install`: Sometimes some pre-conditions must be met in order to be able to install XPerience. This often goes with `before_install_args`. See *_includes/templates/device_specific/before_install_*`before_install`*.md* for possible values.
* `before_install_custom`: This property can be set to be able to display instructions between recovery and the actual XPerience installation. Existing (or to be created) values can be found in *_includes/templates/device_specific/before_install_custom*`before_install_custom`*.md*
* `before_recovery_install`: Set this property to specify if something has to be done before installing the recovery. Values can be found in *_includes/templates/device_specific/before_recovery_install_*`before_recovery_install_`*.md*
* `carrier`: If the device was released for a specific carrier, the name of that carrier.
* `custom_recovery_link`: A custom recovery link in case no official recovery exists for the specific device or it doesn't work properly.
* `custom_unlock_cmd`: Used if the command to unlock your device via fastboot is different than `fastboot oem unlock`.
* `is_ab_device`: Used if the device has an A/B partition scheme.
* `is_unlockable`: Set to false if there is no official method to unlock the bootloader. A hint will appear on the device's overview and install page. If this property is not set, it defaults to `True`
* `required_bootloader`: Specify the bootloader versions which are required to install XPerience. Example:

  ```
  required_bootloader: [Version1, Version2]
  ```
* `sdcard`: Format: `{maxSize: '<size>'}` or `{maxSize: '<size>', slot: '<slot>'}` with
  - `size` being a string like `32 GB` (checked against a pattern `{{ definitions.sdcard_data.properties.sizeMax.pattern }}`) and
  - `slot` being one of
    ```
    {{ definitions.sdcard_data.properties.slot.enum | join: ", " }}
    ```

* `uses_custom_recovery`: Used if the device use custom recovery (disabled by default)

{% include alerts/note.html content="If you need to assign a value to one of the fields which is not allowed by the time you create your change, update the schema validator or contact us to add it" %}

## Testing it works

Start the wiki on your local Jekyll server, and navigate to [the devices list](http://localhost:4000/devices.html). Your device should be there.
Click on it, and check that the info/install/build pages all seem correct.

Now run the validation:

```
bundle install
ruby ./test/validate.rb
```

If the script doesn't give you an output, all the validated fields have a proper format. Otherwise, read the messages carefully to see which fields have to be corrected.

## Submitting wiki changes

After verifying the device-specific pages, commit it and open a pull request at [wiki source code](https://github.com/TheXPerienceProject/wiki/) to review proposed changes.
