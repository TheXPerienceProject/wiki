_XPerience, please support my new device!_

It's up to you.

Sorry to let you down, but XPerience device support has nothing to do with the number of device requests received. The folks who maintain devices for XPerience choose devices that interest them. Remember, these are regular people enjoying a hobby. XPerience is not a corporation with employees.

If you know someone who has knowledge in building ROMs, you can send [this url]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/adding-device/) to that person.
Or donate the device you want to be supported.
