## Installing a custom recovery using `fastboot`

{% if device.uses_custom_recovery %}
1. Download the [custom recovery]({{ custom_recovery_link }}).
{% else %}
{%- assign is_pe_recovery = true %}
1. Download the [XPerience Recovery](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xperience-aosp/files/recovery/{{ device.codename }}). Simply download the latest recovery file.
{% endif %}
    {% include alerts/important.html content="Other recoveries may not work for installation or updates. We strongly recommend to use the one linked above!" %}
2. Connect your device to your PC via USB if it isn't already.
3. If your device isn't already in fastboot mode, on the computer, open a command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on Linux or macOS) window, and type:
```
adb reboot bootloader
```
    {% if device.download_boot %}
    You can also boot into fastboot mode via a key combination:

    * {{ device.download_boot }}
    {% endif %}
4. Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC finds it by typing:
```
fastboot devices
```
   If you don't get any output or an error:
   * on Windows: make sure the device appears in the device manager without a triangle. Try other drivers until the command above works!
   * on Linux or macOS: If you see `no permissions fastboot` try running `fastboot` as root. When the output is empty, check your USB cable and port!

   {% include alerts/tip.html content="Some devices have buggy USB support while in bootloader mode, if you see `fastboot` hanging with no output when using commands such as `fastboot getvar ...`, `fastboot boot ...`, `fastboot flash ...` you may want to try a different USB port (preferably a USB Type-A 2.0 one) or a USB hub." %}
{% if device.needs_fastboot_boot %}
5. Temporarily boot recovery on your device (replace `<recovery_filename>` with the actual filename!):
```
fastboot boot <recovery_filename>.img
```
{% else %}
5. Flash recovery onto your device (replace `<recovery_filename>` with the actual filename!):
```
fastboot flash recovery <recovery_filename>.img
```
6. Now reboot into recovery to verify the installation.
    {%- if device.recovery_reboot %}
    * {% include snippets/recovery_reboot.md %}
    {%- else %}
    Do **not** reboot into the existing OS, since it will overwrite the recovery you just installed!
    * {{ device.recovery_boot }}

      {% include alerts/note.html content="If you can't power down the device, try long-pressing the key-combination (if any was used in the instructions above) until the device reboots and follow the instructions above" %}
    {%- endif %}
