1. Download the [custom recovery]({{ custom_recovery_link }}).

1. Download the [XPerience Recovery](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xperience-aosp/files/{{ device.codename }}). Simply download the latest recovery file.

2. Connect your device to your PC via USB if it isn't already.
3. If your device isn't already in fastboot mode, on the computer, open a command prompt (on Windows) or terminal (on Linux or macOS) window, and type:
```
adb reboot bootloader
```
    {% if device.download_boot %}
    You can also boot into fastboot mode via a key combination:

    * {{ device.download_boot }}
    {% endif %}
4. Once the device is in fastboot mode, verify your PC finds it by typing:
```
fastboot devices
```
  If you don't get any output or an error:
   * on Windows: make sure the device appears in the device manager without a triangle. Try other drivers until the command above works!
   * on Linux or macOS: If you see `no permissions fastboot` try running `fastboot` as root. When the output is empty, check your USB cable (preferably use a USB Type-A 2.0 one or a USB hub) and port!

    {% include alerts/tip.html content="Some devices have buggy USB support while in bootloader mode, if you see `fastboot` hanging with no output when using commands such as `fastboot getvar ... `, `fastboot boot ...`, `fastboot flash ...` you may want to try a different USB port (preferably a USB Type-A 2.0 one) or a USB hub." %}
{% if device.recovery_partition_name  %}
5. Flash the recovery on your device by typing:
```
fastboot flash recovery <recovery_filename>.img
```
{% else %}
5. Flash a recovery on your device by typing (replace `<recovery_filename>` with the actual filename!):
```
fastboot flash boot <recovery_filename>.img
```
    {% include alerts/note.html content="Outdated fastboot releases dropped legacy A/B support, so it might attempt to flash to `boot__a` / `boot__b` rather than `boot_a` / `boot_b` if you try to flash `boot`. In this case, you must update `fastboot` to a release newer than or equal to `31.0.2`. Alternatively, you can manually specify which slot to flash to based on what slot fastboot failed to flash to. For example, if fastboot fails to flash to `boot__a`, you must flash to `boot_a`." %}
6. Now reboot into recovery to verify the installation.
